## What's New

**Polymorphic pointer resolution** — The live bridge now resolves runtime types via RTTI when dereferencing pointer fields. A field declared as `CEntitySubclassVDataBase*` will now show the full derived type (e.g. `CitadelAbilityVData` with 100+ fields) instead of just the base class. Works for all polymorphic pointers — VData, entity pointers, modifiers, etc. The viewer shows the resolved type as a badge with the declared type dimmed beside it.

**Viewer rewrite** — The interactive viewer has been rebuilt from scratch with React 19 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS v4. The 3,453-line monolithic HTML file is now 67 typed source files with virtualized lists, proper state management, and zero XSS vulnerabilities. All existing features preserved — same hash routing, same live entity inspector.

**v1.6.0** — Protobuf descriptor scanner. Decodes embedded `.proto` definitions from game binaries — extracts named fields, types, and message hierarchies for protobuf-only classes like `CBaseUserCmdPB` that have no Source 2 schema registration.

See the full [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for all releases.

## What

A single exe that injects a read-only worker DLL into a running Source 2 game and extracts the complete schema, RTTI, and runtime layout data — in seconds, with zero configuration. Built for educational purposes and reverse engineering research.

**One command, full extraction:**

```bash
dezlock-dump.exe --all
```

## How

1. Download from [Releases](../../releases) (or [build from source](#build-from-source))
2. Launch your game and load into a match or lobby
3. Run as administrator:

```bash
# Deadlock (default)
dezlock-dump.exe --all

# CS2
dezlock-dump.exe --process cs2.exe --all

# Dota 2
dezlock-dump.exe --process dota2.exe --all
```

Output lands in `schema-dump/<game>/` next to the exe.

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--process <name>` | `deadlock.exe` | Target process |
| `--output <dir>` | `schema-dump/<game>/` | Output directory |
| `--signatures` | off | Generate byte pattern signatures |
| `--sdk` | off | Generate cherry-pickable C++ SDK headers |
| `--layouts` | off | Analyze vtable functions for inferred member field offsets |
| `--all` | off | Enable all generators (sdk + signatures + layouts) |

> **Note:** Schema dump finishes in seconds. Signature generation (`--signatures` / `--all`) processes 800k+ functions and can take several minutes.

## Benefits

### Full SDK generation
Cherry-pickable C++ headers with v2-style types (`Vec3`, `QAngle`, `CHandle`), `constexpr` offsets, scoped enums, and `static_assert` validation on every field. Include only what you need — each class gets its own `.hpp`.

```cpp
#include "sdk/client/C_BaseEntity.hpp"
```

### Complete field offsets
Every class with every field — own and inherited — greppable in one file per module.

```
C_CitadelPlayerPawn.m_iHealth = 0x354 (int32, 4) [MNetworkEnable]
C_CitadelPlayerPawn.m_angEyeAngles = 0x11B0 (QAngle, 12)
```

### Entity access paths
Full recursive field trees with pointer chains resolved — grep any class and see the complete offset path to any nested field.

```
# C_CitadelPlayerPawn (size=0x1990)
  +0x10   m_pEntity                -> CEntityIdentity*
            +0x18   m_name                   (CUtlSymbolLarge)
  +0x354  m_iHealth                (int32, C_BaseEntity)
  +0x11B0 m_angEyeAngles           (QAngle)
```

### 10,000+ global singletons auto-discovered
Scans `.data` sections of every loaded module and cross-references against the RTTI vtable catalog. No hardcoded patterns needed.

```
client.dll::CCitadelCameraManager = 0x31F05F0 (static)
engine2.dll::CGameEntitySystem = 0x623AA8 (pointer)
```

### Pattern signatures for every virtual function
IDA-style byte patterns across 58+ DLLs — survive game patches where RVAs shift. Stubs detected, COMDAT deduplication handled, signatures trimmed to shortest unique prefix.

```
CCitadelInput::CreateMove = 48 89 5C 24 ? 55 48 8D AC 24
CSource2Client::idx_0 = 40 53 56 57 48 81
```

### RTTI layout headers
9,000+ non-schema classes get generated struct headers with inferred field offsets from vtable function analysis — no PDB required. Each field has type inference (`float`, `void*`, `uint32_t`, etc.) and access pattern annotations.

```cpp
#include "sdk/client/_rtti/CTraceFilter.hpp"
// namespace sdk::rtti — separate from schema structs
```

### Protobuf message definitions
Decodes serialized `.proto` descriptors embedded in game binaries. Extracts full message definitions with named fields, types, nesting, and oneofs — no PDB or protobuf library required.

```
message CBaseUserCmdPB {
  optional int32 legacy_command_number = 1;
  optional int32 client_tick = 2;
  optional CInButtonStatePB buttons_pb = 3;
  optional CMsgQAngle viewangles = 4;
  optional float forwardmove = 5;
  optional float leftmove = 6;
  optional float upmove = 7;
  repeated CSubtickMoveStep subtick_moves = 18;
  ...
}

message CCitadelUserCmdPB {
  optional CBaseUserCmdPB base = 1;
  optional CMsgVector vec_camera_position = 2;
  optional CMsgQAngle ang_camera_angles = 3;
  optional int32 enemy_hero_aimed_at = 10;
  ...
}
```

### Full RTTI inheritance
23,000+ classes with complete parent chains and vtable RVAs from MSVC x64 RTTI — including internal engine classes with no schema entry (CCitadelInput, CPanoramaUIEngine, CInputSystem, etc.).

### Runtime-scannable patterns in SDK
Global pointer patterns from `patterns.json` are exported as `_patterns.hpp` — drop them into your project and scan at runtime without hardcoded offsets. RIP-relative and derived patterns both supported.

```cpp
#include "sdk/_patterns.hpp"

// Scan at runtime — survives game patches
auto match = find_pattern(client_base, client_size, patterns::client::dwEntityList::sig);
auto addr = resolve_rip(match, patterns::client::dwEntityList::rip_offset);
```

### Supplementary pattern scanning
Optional `patterns.json` for untyped globals that vtable scanning can't find (`dwViewMatrix`, `dwEntityList`, etc.).

## Interactive Viewer

A React + TypeScript viewer for exploring dump output interactively. Built with Vite and Tailwind CSS v4.

**Quick start (development):**

```bash
cd viewer
pnpm install
pnpm dev        # http://localhost:5173
```

**Production build:**

```bash
cd viewer
pnpm build      # outputs to viewer/dist/
```

Then open `viewer/dist/index.html` in any browser, or use `pnpm dev` during development.

1. Drop your `_all-modules.json` onto the landing page (or use the file picker)
2. Browse classes, fields, enums, globals, protobuf messages, and inheritance trees
3. Connect live to inspect entities in real time

**Features:**
- Searchable class/field/enum browser with module filtering (Ctrl+K to focus)
- Sortable field offset tables with own/flattened inherited field toggle
- Clickable inheritance chains — click any parent class to navigate
- Global singletons browser with module grouping and pattern globals
- Full inheritance tree with lazy-loaded collapsible nodes
- Protobuf message browser with nested message/enum support
- Dark/light theme toggle (persisted)
- Virtualized sidebar for smooth scrolling with 5,000+ items
- Works offline with 150MB+ JSON files (parses in a Web Worker)

> **Note:** When both `client.dll` and `server.dll` are present (common in Deadlock/CS2), the exported `_all-modules.json` can reach **500MB+** since many classes are duplicated across both modules. The viewer handles this fine but loading may take a moment. `server.dll` is excluded from the module filter by default — enable it manually if you need server-side class data.

### Live Server

The `--live` flag keeps the exe running after dump and starts a WebSocket server on `ws://127.0.0.1:9100`. The viewer can connect to it for real-time entity inspection — browse live entities, expand nested structs, follow handle references, and watch field values update in real time.

```bash
# Dump + stay live
dezlock-dump.exe --all --live

# Or skip injection entirely — load an existing dump and serve it
dezlock-dump.exe --schema schema-dump/deadlock/_all-modules.json
```

Then open the viewer (`pnpm dev` or `viewer/dist/index.html`) and hit **Connect Live** (or paste `ws://127.0.0.1:9100` into the header bar). The Entities tab appears once connected.

## Build from Source

Requires Visual Studio 2022 with C++ desktop workload and CMake 3.20+ (ships with VS2022).

```bash
cmake -B build -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64
cmake --build build --config Release
```

Or just run `build.bat`. Output lands in `build/bin/Release/`.

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11 (x64)
- Target Source 2 game running with `client.dll` loaded
- Run as **administrator**
